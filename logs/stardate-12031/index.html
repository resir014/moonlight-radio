&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: i shield myself from the freshman and their meme-themed joking ways by climbing up the stairs to upper levels of classmanship. i'm slowly coming near the door out of this hell
&lt;nugflow&gt; log: are you serious? no i'm a skeleton
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I've successfully smuggled my Smuckers Uncrustables on the ship, nobody has noticed them yet. wait, are these logs public?!
&lt;meme_machine&gt; log: can you cook a pbj sandwich on ion drives? let's find out

&lt;Skul&gt; Log: I have been breaking out into hives.  I beleve someone has smuggled peanutbutter onboard
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: i just got my pop tarts. and grape soda, but realized i had another soda, and i am glad that i did not open it.
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: wait now that i realize wouldn't this soda be going everywhere without gravity now
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: OH GOD IT'S ON MY SHIRT HE-
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: after fixing the artificial gravity, i realized that i made a mistake, Kitanai has soda all over them.
&lt;Skul&gt; log: why are these buttons sticky?
&lt;meme_machine&gt; log: ;)
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: after cleaning the 'unknown substance' off the control panel, i realized that the windows are all fogged up again, the prints are back :c
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: when  i got on this ship it wasn't  moving. are we in space are those space rods flying past us
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: *loudly burps*
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: Hoping Yrr will come back soon with an updated map with our current location, as we're in the dark without Wolfgun
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: Conor is back, but we don't know if he can fly the ship, and wolfgun is covered in sticky notes, sleeping, so lets hope we dont hit anything
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: uh guys i think there's soda all over wolfgun's pants how are we gonna explain that to him when he wakes up
&lt;Skul&gt; log: we seem to have received a distress call from what appears to be a green dorito
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: i learned today that it's really hard to draw penises on fur
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: The docking thrusters are FUBAR, so I've gotta order some off SpaceAmazon
&lt;meme_machine&gt; log: does ANYTHING work on this damn ships besides the ion drives
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: everclef ya gotta use a sheath or have fur overlap the base a bit
&lt;meme_machine&gt; log: and the ion drives are really just stoves at this pont
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: why are we talking about this lets not talk about this
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I recieved the parts to fix the replicator, so we can get off the grits only diet
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: but im already eating pop tarts
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: The smell of freshly replicated non-grits food is an amazing smell
&lt;meme_machine&gt; log: can we replicate more grits
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: so are these pop tarts
&lt;meme_machine&gt; log: i like grits
&lt;log&gt; this was not a good idea
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: where did conor go
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: i guess we run the ship now
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I've found more food on the ion drives, and some... fecal matter.
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: where are all of our steel beams
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: how is this ship still moving
&lt;Skul&gt; log: is no one going to address the fact we received a distress call from a humanoid rock?
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: wait, where'd conor go, oh there he is, he's having an identity crisis
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I explained to Everclef that until i get people to stop cooking on the ion drives, we're actually drifting at high speeds, our course being changed by nearby stars gravities
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: guys, HellieCharty has an insane puppy on the ship aboard ow and its really hyper. dont let it grab any of my sodas o
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: that's nice and all but where did all of our steel beams go
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: or shits gonna get broke*
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: i put chicken wire around the ion drives, but there's a pizza stuck in the wire :/
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: hellie will devour it
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: it's a miracle the ship hasn't been torn in half because we have no steel beams anywhere
&lt;HellieCharty&gt; log: actually brb I need to shower since I have work tomorrow
&lt;Kitanai&gt; log: hellie has work getting these beams back
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I have found a secret room in the ship, and ordered steel beams to be delivered
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: when kitanai goes to sleep, let's follow his advice
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: this secret room is filled with @_Ninji's shitposts written all over the walls
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: the artificial gravity went out again, wolfgun's sleeping body is just floating, we dont want to wake him
* krantu puls out a sharpie
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I found out what the red light ment, theres a distress call, but we cant help, wolfgun's asleep.
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: Fixed the ion drives, all working now, but we still dont know the destination of the ship
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: someone is messing with the radio, STARLIGHT radio has been replaced with reruns of Seinfeld
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: wait, the ship is turning... are we headed back to skrillfeld?!?!?
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I've got to fix the radio, to see if we're heading towards skrillfeld
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: some random guy is spitting out binary code, we dont know what he's saying yet.
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: space is scary i wanna go back to EBONY
ghostshadows&gt; log: It seems that it was just Penumbra messing with us
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: someone named batman joined, I dont trust him...
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I've got to check the food replicator, see if my repairs worked
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: either Everclef is lying, or the storage closet was actually not a bathroom

&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: All the repairs today, I've got to take a quick nap, the beds here aren't the best, but they're ok
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: someone shouted something racist then locked themselves in the poop closet. i'm going to get in  the airlock now
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: i'm opening the airlock
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I've waken up, with a sharp pain in my backside, what happened?!?!
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: wait did the airlocks just open?
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: this space vacuum i just exposed the ship to doesn't exist, it's just an illusion
&lt;Penumbra&gt; we're in one of those quarter rides outsde of safeway

&lt;Everclef&gt; log: guys under the "fuel" marker there's just nothing
&lt;Everclef&gt; log: i think we spent all of our fuel making logs
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I put a sign to not go into the improvised bathroom
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: The fuel went out, i guess we're slowing down...
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: we seem to be decreasing speed at 12 meters a second per half hour
&lt;Everclef&gt; at least when we die, and people discover the remains of our ship, they can look at us and say "at least they had a separate room to poop in"
&lt;ghostshadows&gt; log: I've started research on alternative fuel for the ion drives, and i think we can!
