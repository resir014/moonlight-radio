&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Depends on your definition of alive
* Everclef opens the airlock and immediately closes it again
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Don't do that
&lt;+Everclef&gt; yeah, i hate leaving the airlock closed too because everything stinks after a while
&lt;+Everclef&gt; but they make us do it, so
* Notify: undefined is online (STARLIGHT).
* Notify: undefined is offline (STARLIGHT).
* Notify: undefined is online (STARLIGHT).
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; You know what I mean
* undefined has joined #starlight
* conor gives voice to undefined
&lt;+Everclef&gt; well excuse me for not liking a stinky ship
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Every millisecond that door is open is another kg of fuel that's is required by life support to replenish the oxygen.
&lt;+undefined&gt; back
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; wb
&lt;+Everclef&gt; nobody told life to have such stringent rules
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Noone did, but here we are
&lt;+Everclef&gt; and i didn't open the outer airlock
&lt;+Everclef&gt; just the inner one
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; i like sitting in the airlock sometimes
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; pressing my ear up to the outer airlock
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; and listening to nothingn
&lt;+Everclef&gt; the stinky air diffuses into the airlock and i can slowly make the ship smell less  if i do it for  an hour
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; The airlock is not that big
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: deadmau5 - Glish] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; And you'd still have to purge the air to do that again
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; And we have air scrubbers for that
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; I love when my "friends" say we're gonna do something, then make an excuse for not doing it right now, then never getting back to me
&lt;+Nergal&gt; thats life
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Pogo - Nicey Nicey] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; luckily I have my 90 ton Mauler to keep me company
&lt;+Everclef&gt; the air scrubbers don't keep up
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Then submit a ticket I don't know. Just don't waste fuel, credits are hard to come by when you don't have jobs.
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; i have a job thank you very much
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: deadmau5 - A Moment to Myself] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; its to annoy you
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Let me know when that starts paying
&lt;+undefined&gt; who pays you?
* Notify: shadows is online (STARLIGHT).
* shadows has joined #starlight
* conor gives voice to shadows
&lt;+undefined&gt; you're back
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Well shadows
&lt;+Everclef&gt; does it matter that much
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Congratulations for sleeping when you said you would
&lt;+Everclef&gt; the only use for the currency is when game night rolls around
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; me and rivenwolf have a barter system set up
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; And fuel and food. Y'know the things needed to survive.
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Barter with what?
&lt;+Everclef&gt; we're out in space and talk to no one
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; &gt;_&gt;
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; &lt;_&lt;
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; secrets....
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; What resource do we have that is possibly renewable?
&lt;+Everclef&gt; besides you only need to worry about food when you don't have sheep hexagons
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Pendulum - Vault] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; memes are renewable
&lt;+Everclef&gt; and no one's inept enough to leave out sheep
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Memes are not a resource
&lt;+Everclef&gt; how so?!
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Because there is no demand
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; At least any marketable one
&lt;+Everclef&gt; on what ship is there no demand for memes
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Any
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; cory is a meme
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; nugflow is a meme
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; bees
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; bears
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; legs
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; skrillfeld
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; so may memes, so many sources of fuel
&lt;+Everclef&gt; i'll take all of those for 10 wolfopoly dollars
&lt;+undefined&gt; there was even a new meme today
&lt;+undefined&gt; kind of
&lt;+Everclef&gt; and we make all our own food with a really nice compost  system, that'll last for about another 27000 years or so
&lt;+Everclef&gt; just as long as we keep pooping we'll be fine
&lt;+Nergal&gt; memebee
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; i want to spend all my wolfopoly dollars on a new spacesuit
&lt;+Everclef&gt; why a new spacesuit
&lt;+Everclef&gt; it's all about the dog stickers
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; And that compost system goes though a re-enricher. You cant make protein and vitamins out of nothing, those resources cost credits.
&lt;+Everclef&gt; you put enough on your suit and you become a walking meme
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; but dog stickers cant survive the vaccum
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; and plus, i need something to put my stickers on
&lt;+Everclef&gt; spacesuits don't wear out that quickly
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; i never had one to start off with
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Daft Punk - Veridis Quo] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; ive been wearing the same outfit since this ship left earth
&lt;+Everclef&gt; and if they do wear out too quickly for you, that's what the nugflow 6x8 notebook is for
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; spess suit
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; i need
&lt;+Everclef&gt; well atlas that's why we have memes
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; MEMES ARE NOT A RESOURCE
&lt;+Nergal&gt; they are a curse
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; That too
&lt;+Everclef&gt; don't you remember way back in the 2010s when sociobiologists determined that certain phrases, when spoken out loud, and frequently, have a tendency to generate proteins and vitamins randomly at a frequency greater than other infrequent, less meme-y phrases
&lt;+Nergal&gt; ...what
&lt;+Nergal&gt; I need some proofs
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; ^
&lt;+undefined&gt; energy can be converted to matter
&lt;+Nergal&gt; that is true...
&lt;+undefined&gt; memes have energy
&lt;+undefined&gt; therefore, memes are a resource
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Memes have no energy
&lt;+Everclef&gt; best syllogism 10/10
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; They are a concept
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; They are the byproduct of energy
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; MEMES FUEL THE WORLD
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; NO
&lt;+Everclef&gt; when we say 'meme' we mean the physical interaction of the concept with the world around us
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Mystery Skulls - The Future] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; energy never dies
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; That consumes energy
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; therefore the energy spent on memes is merely transferring to the ship
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Which is dissipated in the form of heat
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; exactly heat energy
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; Ninji go to sleep
&lt;+Everclef&gt; so when we say 'dank memes make energy' we mean that the noumenal object interacts with the physical world through memes
&lt;+Ninji&gt; :|
&lt;+Everclef&gt; memery*
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; the damn ants are back
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; In order for that theory to work, all systems need to be at least 100% efficient, which is impossible.
&lt;+Everclef&gt; why does that have to hold for meme theory to be true
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Knife Party - Superstar] | [Listeners: 1]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; memes are not bound by the laws of physics
&lt;+resir014&gt; the meme equation
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; for they are not from this dimension, they are from the memension
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; You are arguing that through the exerted thermal energy through the interaction generated by memes, we can generate energy. Correct?
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; si senor
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; That is not possible because that requires a 100% efficient closed system, which is not physically possible.
&lt;+Everclef&gt; the rate at which proteins and vitamins are randomly created increases exponentially as a meme becomes more popular
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; bam
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Proof
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; memes can reach up to 911% efficiency
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; no i take that back
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; only 420%
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; I can see we've already abandoned logic'
&lt;+Nergal&gt; memes did 911?
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Wolfgun - Red] | [Listeners: 2]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; yse nergal
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; yes they did
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; Bush was a meme all along
&lt;+Everclef&gt; after a certain point of popularity the use of memes supplements our regular compost system enough that we have can sustain ourselves for a very long time
&lt;+Everclef&gt; [1][2][3]
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; That makes no sense
* Everclef has quit (Quit: quit)
* Everclef has joined #starlight
* conor gives voice to Everclef
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Pogo - Anna] | [Listeners: 2]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; ATLAS
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; none of this makes sense
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; that is the point of memes
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; When you abandon logic and proper science, I abandon interest
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; but what is science really?
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; who wrote the rules?
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; why are things the way they are?
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; what if in another dimension memes really are a fuel source?
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Reality
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; how do you know we haven;t already left our own dimension
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; It'd be obvious
&lt;+Everclef&gt; [1] International Center of Meme Study, 2012, p.44-103b
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; And there are still fundamental laws all dementions must follow. Otherwise the whole thing falls apart on itself.
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Wolfgun - CHRONICLE] | [Listeners: 2]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; but how do you know this to be true?
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; http://s9.postimg.org/ilbqgw57j/Untitled.png
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Uppermost - Different] | [Listeners: 2]
&lt;+Everclef&gt; [2] Hale (1986), dog (1993). "Memes and the physical world". Meme Theory 69 (130): 20-24.
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; These sources are bogus
&lt;+Everclef&gt; silly atlas, our google is restricted to data on the ship
&lt;+Everclef&gt; we can't actually get the earth internet so we can't check
&lt;+Everclef&gt; the ship doesn't have these papers on hand
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; We can get a connection through dimension hopping connections
&lt;+Everclef&gt; that's not a real thing
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; ATLAS IS THIS NOT ENOUGH PROOF FOR YOU?
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; https://acparmyofclubpenguin.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/shrke-illuminate.png
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; ATLAS we dont have access to an HPG
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; "higher-dimensional"
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; therefore no lightspeed communications
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; We have access
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; By node hopping through dimensions
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; thats not a thing
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; &gt;:C
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; It is
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; stop making stuff up
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; It's something that's ACTUALLY explained through quantum mechanics
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; atleast we have proof to back up our claims
&lt;+Everclef&gt; it's hypothetical
&lt;+Everclef&gt; which means we haven't found it yet
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Your claims are nonexistant
&lt;+Everclef&gt; so how could we use it if it's too fast for us to capture and use
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; How can we use memes when there is 0 research on them?
&lt;+Everclef&gt; memes interact with the physical world in a largely similar way that the mind interacts with the world
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; the universe was made by thought not matter
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; Even if that were true, there's no proof
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; mind made matter, not the other way around
&lt;@STARLIGHT&gt; [NOW PLAYING: Mat Zo - Easy (feat. Porter Robinson)] | [Listeners: 2]
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; for it is your mind that allows you to percieve the matter
&lt;+ATLAS_Moon&gt; me is done with this conversation
* ATLAS_Moon is done with this conversation
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; 300 HUNDRED XP AWAY
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; DAMNIT
&lt;+Nergal&gt; dogecoins
&lt;+Everclef&gt; that's a problem m'losophy solves
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; my job here is done
&lt;+Nergal&gt; vs wolfopoly dollars
&lt;+Everclef&gt; well in one of the competing theories anyway
&lt;+Penumbra&gt; i get payed 10 wolfopoly dollars for making ATLAS annoyed
&lt;+Everclef&gt; but they're solid theories
